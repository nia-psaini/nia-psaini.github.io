  <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
  <h2>My Goals and Values</h2>
  
  <p> &nbsp;I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, building on an Associate’s Degree in Liberal Arts: Science, Math, and Technology earned at Madison Area Technical College (MATC). My experience spans technical coursework, customer service roles, and leadership in student organizations.</p>
  
<p id="whitespace"> &nbsp;Working as a front-end associate at Walmart, I gained skills in handling sensitive financial data and training new employees, which strengthened my attention to detail, communication, and ability to work under pressure. Similarly, my role as a customer service representative at Janak Trucking LLC involved managing confidential billing data and digitizing records, further developing my focus on privacy and organization. </p>
  

<p id="whitespace"> &nbsp;Alongside work experience, I have taken on leadership roles in clubs such as Ladies of Royalty and Prevention Players, where I organized events and managed budgets. These opportunities enhanced my skills in accountability, teamwork, and long-term planning—qualities essential in cybersecurity. </p>

<p id="whitespace"> &nbsp;I am passionate about using technology to protect sensitive information, especially in healthcare settings, and I am eager to apply my knowledge of programming languages like JavaScript and C/C++ in a collaborative environment. I am committed to continuous learning and contributing effectively to a team focused on cybersecurity and data protection. </p>
  
 <p><strong>Long-Term Goals</strong></p>
 <ul>
 <li>Become a Cybersecurity Analyst
 <li>Learn in-depth Web Development
 <li>Obtain Masters in Information Technology
 </ul>
